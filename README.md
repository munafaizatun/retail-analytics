## Project 1: Customer Segment & Chips Purchasing Behavior Analysis

### Objective

To analyze customer segments and their purchasing behavior in the chips category, helping the Category Manager (Julia) develop targeted strategies for growth.

### Key Steps

1. **Data Preparation** – Cleaned and structured transactional data.
2. **Feature Engineering** – Extracted features such as pack size, brand name, and customer segment.
3. **Exploratory Analysis** – Identified key patterns in purchase volume, frequency, and spend.
4. **Insight Generation** – Interpreted seasonal trends, segment behaviors, and value contributions.

### Key Insights

* **Standard pack sizes (≈175g)** dominate sales and represent the core category.
* **December** shows a consistent **sales peak**, reflecting seasonal demand.
* **Premium customers** drive high margins despite smaller basket sizes.
* **Older Families and Retirees** maintain strong and stable volume contributions.

### Strategic Implications

* Focus **premium promotions** on high-value customers for margin growth.
* Run **volume-driven campaigns** for mainstream family and senior segments to maintain steady sales.

## Project 2: Trial Store Performance Evaluation

### Objective

To assess the impact of a promotional trial conducted in stores **77, 86, and 88**, comparing trial results against control stores to determine if sales or customer behavior significantly changed.

### Approach

* Selected representative **control stores** based on sales and customer similarity (using correlation and magnitude distance).
* Scaled pre-trial data for fair comparison.
* Conducted **t-tests** and confidence interval analysis to evaluate significance.
* Visualized performance trends during pre-trial and trial periods.

### Findings

| Trial Store | Control Store | Key Findings                                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **77**      | 233           | Sales and customer count both increased significantly — strong trial effect.      |
| **86**      | 155           | Customer visits rose, but sales impact not significant — possible pricing effect. |
| **88**      | 178           | Higher sales but lower customer counts — spending per customer increased.         |

### Strategic Implications

* Trial had **positive but varied impact** across stores.
* Recommends deeper review of **promotional design and pricing** strategies for scalability.
